# CitiesApp

I am developing this app to learn better about the MEAN Stack. 
The back-end is being based on this screencast 
[Build an Express JS APP with tdd](https://www.codeschool.com/screencasts/build-an-express-js-app-with-tdd)
and the front-end I am trying to implement by reading tutorials.

# Run Server
`
bin/www
`

# Run Client
You should go to the folder `client` and then:

`
npm start
`
